# Testcase

- Navigate to `main.test.js`
- Run `Tasks: Run Build Task`

## What happens

The task glob for `kind: test` executes

## What's expected

The build task executes because that's the only build task in the list of tasks.
I didn't run `Tasks: Run Test Task` so the test task should not have executed
